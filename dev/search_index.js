This is an enhanced version of the terminal logger Logging.ConsoleLogger which comes installed with Julia by default.\n\nLog levels less than min_level are filtered out.\n\nMessage formatting can be controlled by setting keyword arguments:\n\nmeta_formatter is a function which takes the log event metadata (level, _module, group, id, file, line) and returns a color (as would be passed to printstyled), prefix and suffix for the log message.  The default is to prefix with the log level and a suffix containing the module, file and line location.\nshow_limited limits the printing of large data structures to something which can fit on the screen by setting the :limit IOContext key during formatting.\nright_justify is the integer column which log metadata is right justified at. The default is zero (metadata goes on its own line).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"}]
